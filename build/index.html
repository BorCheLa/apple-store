  The reason it’s called a life experience platform is because the app is designed to encourage
  you to take action in your life – through experiences and playlists, as well as showcase your
  accomplishments and life experiences to your community!

  Experiences
  Experiences are pieces of content that showcase different experiences that you can have. They are limitless and are as diverse as each and every one of us. Examples include hobbies, cooking, travel, outdoor recreation, art, entertainment, sports, movies, makeup, and so much more! You can accept Experiences and add them to a Playlist. Upon accepting an Experience, you are able to post or complete them. Posting about Experiences is very similar to posting on other Social Media. Completing an experience allows you to mark an experience as complete, and ‘check it off’.

  Beanstalk is already populated with hundreds of thousands of experiences – so you can interact on the app from day one. If you still aren’t able to find an experience that you’re searching for, you will easily be able to create it! Beanstalk is a platform that gives you the flexibility and creativity to make any experience you!

  Playlists
  Playlist is a pretty common term in today's world - they are a list filled with songs or videos! Beanstalk has playlists too - but for experiences.

  Playlists are a list of experiences that a person wants to accomplish during a specific time period. Beanstalk gives you the ability to create playlists and fill them with lists of Experiences. For example, you may be passionate about traveling, and would like to create a ‘travel playlist’  filled with all of the places you would like to visit! Beanstalk gives you the ability to create as many playlists as you want so you can organize the experiences that you have accepted or created. Additionally, Beanstalk allows you to search for, and accept, playlists made by businesses and other users.

  WHAT CAN YOU DO ON BEANSTALK?

  Find what life has to offer. Whether that’s mountain biking, trying the latest restaurant, hanging out with friends or family, traveling around the world, or even base jumping off of a mountain. Beanstalk has something for everyone. You are easily able to find your community of similar minded people!

  Create experiences and playlists and share them with others. Let other people know about an experience and invite them to try it! Do you know the best Mexican restaurant in town?

  Explore all of the amazing experiences that life has to offer! Beanstalk has hundreds of thousands of experiences and playlists already pre-populated from day one. You are able to explore something specific, or just explore at random and discover all of the cool and unique things that Beanstalk has to offer.
